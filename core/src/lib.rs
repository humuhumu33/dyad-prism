//! The dyad-prism trust core, as Lean verified it.
//!
//! Every body in `generated/dyad_core.rs` is the exact `prod-codegen`
//! output from the LCNF export of the kernel checked module
//! `PrismDyad.Dyad` (Lean 4.32.1, leanchecker replayed,
//! exact per declaration axiom sets), produced by `scripts/lane.sh` from the
//! PrismPM commit in `PRISMPM_REV`. Nothing here is written by hand except
//! this file, which only names the refusal type the generated code returns.
//! The generated code uses owned strings and vectors, so this crate links std.
