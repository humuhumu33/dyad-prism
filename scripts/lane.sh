#      lock, check, build, verify the authored model under Lean 4.32.1
#      (leanchecker replay, exact per declaration axiom policy).
#   2. lean4-prod, also as PrismPM vendors it: export every definition root to
#      kernel LCNF twice (byte identical), then generate Rust twice (byte
#      identical) into generated/dyad_core.rs.
#   3. Compile the generated Rust for the host and for wasm32-unknown-unknown.
#
# Needs: git, cargo (rustup), python3, and the elan toolchain
# leanprover/lean4:v4.32.1 (installed on demand; the only network use besides
# the first PrismPM clone).
